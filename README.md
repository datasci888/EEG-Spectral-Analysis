## Introduction

This repository provides insights into the effects of the Chakra-MarmaKosha Meditation (CM II) technique on academic success and student well-being. Elevated stress and inattention levels, which are detrimental to academic performance, can be alleviated through meditation techniques. The CM II meditation technique, developed specifically for this research, aims to improve students' attention levels. 

## Methodology

The CM II is a three-stage guided meditation, which includes:
- Past emotional cleansing
- Reviewing the day
- Visualizing future components

The meditation is further enhanced with flute music, based on a chosen Raga. To gauge the attentional shifts due to this meditation, we employed an AI model, achieving a commendable accuracy of 98%. This model was further refined to conduct a detailed spectral analysis for understanding the nuances in attention due to meditation.

## Experiment Details

The study involved an in-person EEG experiment where 15 college students partook in the CM II meditation process. Post-meditation, the EEG spectral analysis highlighted significant enhancements in attentional focus, particularly evident from the marked decrease in TBR and the notable surge in TGR. The AI model predictions, indicating a shift of most participants to an attentive state post-meditation, were further corroborated by attention scores sourced from TestMyBrain.com.
